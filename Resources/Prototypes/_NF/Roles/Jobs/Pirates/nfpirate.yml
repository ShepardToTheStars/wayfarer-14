# This entire file has been commented out and moved to Resources/Prototypes/_WF/Entities/Objects/Specific/Outlaw/outlaw.yml.
# We still want to use some of the old pirate entity IDs on the backend so we don't have to change crazy amounts of references in the code.
# If there's a conflict here, we need to look at if it *shouldn't* be ported over because it probably doesn't fit with our antag structure.
